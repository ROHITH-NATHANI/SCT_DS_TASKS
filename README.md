## Objective

The main objective is to apply data science methodologies—including **data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and machine learning model building**—to extract meaningful insights and provide actionable recommendations.

---

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Data Distribution Visualization
Visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable (e.g., age, gender) using a bar chart or histogram.

### Task 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform data cleaning and EDA on a dataset (e.g., Titanic). Explore relationships between variables and identify patterns.

### Task 3: Predictive Modeling with Decision Tree Classifier
Build a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior based on demographic and behavioral data (e.g., Bank Marketing dataset).

### Task 4: Traffic Accident Data Analysis
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.
